             <img class="about" src="assets/images/photo.png"> I'm a father of 2 children who is currently working full-time and has an unheathly obsession with memes.<br><br> I'm taking the coding bootcamp because coding has been something that has always interested me and I'm looking to start a new career upon completion.
                In my freetime I enjoy watching movies with my kids or alone.  I also enjoy lifting weights in my newly completed garage gym. <br><br>Sometimes when I get downtime before bed I enjoy surfing social media or Reddit for a good laugh.
