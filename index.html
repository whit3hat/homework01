            I'm a father of 2 children who is currently working full-time and has an unheathly obsession with memes. I'm taking the coding bootcamp because coding has been something that has always interested me and I'm looking to start a new career upon completion.

            In my freetime I enjoy watching movies with my kids or alone.  I also enjoy lifting weights in my newly completed garage gym. Sometimes when I get downtime before bed I enjoy surfing social media or Reddit for a good laugh.
